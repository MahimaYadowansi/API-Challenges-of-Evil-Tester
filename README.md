## Overview:
This project introduces a robust approach to API testing by combining response validation and automated error reporting in a seamless workflow. After receiving a response, the system intelligently validates it to ensure it meets expected criteria, such as correct status codes and data integrity. For real-time insights, meaningful logs are generated, including status codes and their corresponding meanings, to streamline debugging. In cases of unexpected responses, the project takes proactive action by automatically creating a detailed Jira issue. Each issue includes essential information like the status code, its meaning, and a descriptive summary to guide investigation. This approach not only ensures comprehensive testing but also enhances collaboration and efficiency by making error management faster and more actionable.
